  title: 'Multi-Objective Optimization of LLM Trading Agents: Balancing Profit and
    Adversarial Robustness'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'LLM trading agents face a fundamental trade-off between profit maximization
    and adversarial robustness, where increased defensive measures against prompt
    injection attacks reduce trading performance by 15-30%. However, multi-objective
    optimization techniques can identify Pareto-optimal solutions that maintain competitive
    returns while achieving substantial robustness improvements.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Large language model-based trading agents are increasingly vulnerable
      to prompt injection attacks that can manipulate their decision-making processes,
      potentially causing significant financial losses. Current research focuses on
      either profit optimization or security independently, but real-world deployment
      requires simultaneous consideration of both objectives.

      '
  methodology:
    approach: Design and evaluate multi-objective optimization frameworks for LLM
      trading agents using simulated trading environments with adversarial prompt
      injection scenarios.
    steps:
    - Implement baseline LLM trading agents with standard profit maximization objectives
    - Develop adversarial prompt injection attack suite targeting trading decisions
    - Design multi-objective optimization framework balancing profit and robustness
      metrics
    - Evaluate Pareto frontiers across different market conditions and attack intensities
    - Analyze trade-off relationships and identify optimal operating points
    metrics:
    - Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns under normal conditions
    - Performance degradation under adversarial attacks
    - Robustness score against prompt injection attempts
    - Pareto frontier efficiency metrics
